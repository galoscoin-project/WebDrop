Why
THIS!

Case 1: I want to share files with my friend's phone or computer, but we don't have a USB cable. I have a file sharing app A, my friend have B. Both of us argue "A is better", "No, B is better". The app installation size is 50MB, is half bloatware and the arguing cost us 15 minutes. If it's an iPhone & an Android, ohnooooo. Bonus: iPhone + Android + Windows PC together ðŸ™‚

Case 2: I want to copy a text from my phone to computer, arghhðŸ˜« I have to open WhatsApp Web/Telegram now, send a message to myself -_- ðŸ˜’

Both the above problems are solved with WebDrop. Simply open the website on any number of your devices (even simultaneously) and share files & messages !

Development
Clone the repo and do :

yarn install
yarn start
WebTorrent trackers list is included in src/main.ts. You may want to change that or add/start your own tracker locally for development.

File is shared via streams using simple-peer-files library.

Starting Local Tracker
Install [bittorrent-tracker] globally :

yarn global add bittorrent-tracker
Download this script and run it. It only requires bittorrent-tracker.
